# PHP OOP Calculator

This is a simple calculator written in PHP using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

It takes two numbers as properties and returns the below calculations using methods built into the Class:

- Multiplication
- Division
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Exponent

The two set of numbers hardcoded into this program are:

  $calc1 -> number1 = 6; <br>
  $calc1 -> number2 = 3; <br>

and <br>

  $calc2 -> number1 = 4; <br>
  $calc2 -> number2 = 2;
  <br>

The output is as follows:

  6 x 3 = 18 <br>
  6 / 3 = 2 <br>
  6 + 3 = 9 <br>
  6 - 3 = 3 <br>
  6 ** 3 = 216 <br>
<br>
  4 x 2 = 8 <br>
  4 / 2 = 2 <br>
  4 + 2 = 6 <br>
  4 - 2 = 2 <br>
  4 ** 2 = 16 <br>

- Added a setter and getter and changed the first set of numbers to show how these can be used
