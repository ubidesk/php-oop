# PHP OOP Calculator

This is a simple calculator written in PHP using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

It takes two numbers as properties and returns the below calculations using methods built into the Class:

- Multiplication
- Division
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Exponent

The two set of numbers hardcoded into this program are:

  $calc1 -> number1 = 6;
  $calc1 -> number2 = 3;

and 

  $calc2 -> number1 = 4;
  $calc2 -> number2 = 2;

The output is as follows:

  6 x 3 = 18
  6 / 3 = 2
  6 + 3 = 9
  6 - 3 = 3
  6 ** 3 = 216

  4 x 2 = 8
  4 / 2 = 2
  4 + 2 = 6
  4 - 2 = 2
  4 ** 2 = 16
